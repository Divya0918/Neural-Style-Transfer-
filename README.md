# Neural-Style-Transfer

## Overview
This project implements Neural Style Transfer, a deep learning technique that applies the artistic style of one image (style image) to the content of another image (content image). The result is a stylized image that preserves the content while adopting the visual appearance of the style image. The implementation uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract content and style features and optimize an output image by minimizing content and style loss.



## Features
 Applies artistic style from one image to another,
 Uses deep learning and convolutional neural networks,
 Generates visually appealing stylized images,
 Adjustable style and content weights,
 Clear and modular implementation



## Tools & Technologies
 Python,
 PyTorch,
 Neural Style Transfer,
 Pre-trained VGG network,
 Google Colab


## Execution
The project was developed and executed using Google Colab for efficient computation and ease of experimentation.



## Output
The final output is a stylized image that combines the content of the original image with the artistic style of the selected style image.
